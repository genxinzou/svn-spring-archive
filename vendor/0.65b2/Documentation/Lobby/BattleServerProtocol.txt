Battle server protocol specification

First, when connecting to the battle server, the user credentials need to be sent.  This MUST be the first packet sent

struct Credentials
{
	int ID;
	char Password[MAXPASSWORD];
	char Clan[MAXCLAN];
	char Name[MAXNAME];
};

Provided the user is not already in the room and the password (if needed) is correct, the login is made and PACK_BATTLELOGGEDIN is sent back to the user.
