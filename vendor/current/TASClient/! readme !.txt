In order to compile the sources, you'll have to install modified
TjanTracker component (I've included it with these sources) and also
some other components:

Virtual TreeView component: http://www.lischke-online.de/VirtualTreeview/
TWSocket (ICS): http://www.overbyte.be/frame_index.html?redirTo=/ssl.html
GraphicEx: http://www.soft-gems.net/Graphics.php
RichEditURL (Included with these sources - just install RichEditURL.pas)
JVCL (http://homepages.borland.com/jedi/jvcl/)

I used Delphi 7 to compile the program.
