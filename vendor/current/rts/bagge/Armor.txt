//This file contains the different armor types that exist in the game
//The units listed under an armor type will belong to that category
//All unlisted ones will belong to the default category (not listed in the file)

//Weapons work in much the same way
//They do the default damage against all categories except if they have a special damage against one of the units in a category

//In the future its of course meant that the units should have a ArmorType tag in the fbi file
//And that weapons should list damage against armor categories instead of against units
//This will make it easier to add new units without having to change all the old weapons

//The numbers after the names doesnt mean anything its just that i think the parser likes them
