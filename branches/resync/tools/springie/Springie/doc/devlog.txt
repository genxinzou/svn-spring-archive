===============================
SPRINGIE 0.98
===============================

- !setgametitle added
- lobby admins now have separate default rights level (set it in game settings, default level is 4)
- if spectator kicking is enabled, server automatically locks up when full and unlocks when less than full to prevent annoying kicks
- fixed bug in springie that caused some games to be stuck in "in game status". This used to happen when spring crashed during startup.
