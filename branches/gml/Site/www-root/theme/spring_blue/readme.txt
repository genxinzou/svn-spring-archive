Spring Blue

This is the default theme for Spring's site (at this point in time).
It should be a good example to build your own theme on, but do note that everything about the site is released under the terms of the GPL.
The theme should be light on Fnordia's connection, we don't like to take him off-line every time we have a bump in site visitors.

Made by Tim Blokdijk 2007.
