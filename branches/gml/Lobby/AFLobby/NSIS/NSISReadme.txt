NSIS 2 AFLobby Installer

put all the AFLobby stuff into a dist2 folder in the main AFLobby project folder such that the dist
folder and the dist2 folder are in the same folder. This should be all the files AFLobby needs to
run under windows in their correct folder heirarchy, assuming the install target is the spring
folder.

The installer uses custom header logo and side images which can eb found in bitmap format or in
their original photoshop files. Credits to http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/Modern%20UI/Readme.html
for helping me figure that out.

You'll need to put a copy of the LGPL 2.0 license in this folder under the filename gpl.txt
