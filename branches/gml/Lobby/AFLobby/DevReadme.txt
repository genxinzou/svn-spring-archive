AFLobby needs Sun Java 1.6 to build.

It may require some netbeans things but I'd have to build it without netbeans to find out.

The substance library is also needed (substance.jar), I'm currently using the development build of
v4 not the stable 3.3 as 3.3 crashes more often and isnt as reliable. It can be found at:
https://substance.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=7301&expandFolder=7301&folderID=0

AFLVersion.txt is the file used for AFLobby autoupdating.

At a later date it would be a good idea to finish moving flags and stuff fromt he /src/images/
folder to package 1
