Remove any previous Profiles from older versions

Get unitsync.so / unitsync.dll (windows support still to be coded).

	If u using svn
		scons configure
		scons omni
	Or if u are using gentoo
		add the useflag omni

U will need to copy unitsync.so / unitsync.dll into the client directory

U will need to make the following files excutable
	./Unity.py
	./Profile.py
	./client/main.py

In Profile Setup the datadir should be set to your (rw) datadir.
	If u leave this blank it will use what unitsync reports as being datadirs.
