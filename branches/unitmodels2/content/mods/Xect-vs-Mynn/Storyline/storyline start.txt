We take the old TA community, happy bunch of campers that they were.
They are the Mynn.
The Mynn lived by the rules (called the "Enigne") written by ChrisT.
Live was good, life was simple but after what seemed like to be a decade the old rules were starting to become less compatible with the reality's of the "New Millennium".
Unfortunately for the Mynn, ChrisT was battling demons in his new "Dungeon Search" quests.
He did not have the time to update the "Enigne" he had written to lead his people in the dynamics of the "New Millennium".
Disappointed a few of the Mynn set out to rewrite the "Enigne" from scratch.

And if it needed to be rewritten only ChrisT would have that right.
This split the Mynn and those that started to live to the teachings of the new "Enigne" started to call them self the Xect.
The Xect grew large as they where better adapted to the "New Millennium".
But then ChrisT returned from his second "Dungeon Search" quest and decided...
