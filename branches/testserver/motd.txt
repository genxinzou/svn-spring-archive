Welcome on the test server of the Spring project!

Weekly test game time is Wednesday, 20:00 UTC. Visit
http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/ to convert this
into your local time.

Be sure to file bugs and especially regressions in our bug
tracking system: http://spring.clan-sy.com/mantis
Do not forget to include the Spring revision number!

A regression is a bug that was not present in an earlier
build in a feature that was present in the earlier build.
In other words, it worked before, but is broken now.

Enjoy your stay, and thanks for your testing efforts!
