BUGS
Things todo if u got free time.
Plently of things todo aswell as Lobby Protocol Code.

Hosting Battles 
			Need a Better Way to pick a Mod when hosting a Battle. ( Yes i consider this a UI Bug )

Battle Lobby Code
			Add handling if user aborts entering password for joining a Battle
		 	Needs to updated to prevent user from changing Mod
			Check if player == Host for mouse popup menu in Player List & for changing Maps
			Need Better Way to Display Spectators  ( Maybe see about Lighter Text in Player List )
			Updated Player || Map Info ( Not hard todo)

Lobby Code
			Doesnt have exception handly if Lobby Server is stopped / restarted & Server itself can still be pinged.

			Reallly Realllly Need a Timer Class (threaded) with exception handling so easy to get usefull debugging info.
				Instead of current ulgy solution of adding exception handling to each    def foo:
					Whoever codes this is my personnaly hero. Spend more time figuring whats going wrong, than actually coding app.

			Some Server Exceptions in Lobby.py isnt tied into UI yet.

Config Code
			Needs a rewrite to support xml file. To easy to lose track off option changes. A xml file support would solve this problem.

Setup Code
			Finish off code for automatic profile setup. I.E skeleton file for setup for Linux Packages for spring. So when user first runs UnityLobby,
				with no console switch it will use skeletion file to create first profile.
			
			Cleanup Code .springrc nolonger is created by unitsync & empty. Remove excess code that checks for this.

Graphics
			Fix up Lobby Rankings to .png with transparency to avoid the white rough outlines. Currently files is just my quick & dirty altering image.
