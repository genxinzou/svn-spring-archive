The long term plan is something along the lines of set up a site "framework" where the spring community is "split"* into gamers
and developers and then gamers in the "new casual gamers" that drop by and like to see the screenshots and the "hardcore RTS gamers"
that like to have a league, clan support etc. And the developers in "code dev's" and "content dev's".

* Split as in one overall site that is heavily interlinked betweens the sections
but still with distinct parts so that an UpSpring coder won't have to read about who is the new KoAA in the league.
And non-developers won't disrupt technical discussions between developers with uninformed opinions and feature requests.
