This is upspring code released under GPL license. 
If you make any modifications or port it or something, I'd appriciate if you send me 
an update for it so I can possibly include it in the standard upspring release.

All libraries that I used are portable to linux (little endian only), so in general
it shouldn't be a lot of effort to port it, only small compiler differences.
